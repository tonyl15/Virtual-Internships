# OrderBot Automation Solution - Presentation Outline

## Slide 1: The Problem - Our Current Order Process Is a Bottleneck

### Visual Elements

- **Flowchart of Current Manual Process** (left side of slide)
  - Email Reception → Manual Reading → Account Check → Inventory Check → Decision Point → Manual Emails
  - Use red arrows and warning icons to highlight bottlenecks
  - Include time estimates for each step

### Key Points

- **Current Process Pain Points:**

  - Manual PDF reading (5-10 minutes per order)
  - Manual Salesforce lookup (2-3 minutes)
  - Manual inventory check (1-2 minutes)
  - Manual email drafting (3-5 minutes)
  - **Total: 11-20 minutes per order**

- **Business Impact:**
  - 50+ orders per day = 9-17 hours of manual work
  - Delays during staff absences
  - Human errors in data entry
  - Inconsistent response times
  - Customer dissatisfaction

### Supporting Data

- Average order processing time: 15 minutes
- Error rate: 3-5%
- Customer complaints about delays: 12 per month
- Staff overtime costs: $2,400/month

## Presentation Design Guidelines

### Visual Style

- **Color Scheme**:
  - Red for problems and pain points
  - Green for solutions and benefits
  - Blue for technical details
  - Orange for calls to action

### Typography

- **Headlines**: Bold, 24pt
- **Body Text**: Regular, 18pt
- **Data Points**: Bold, 20pt
- **Captions**: Regular, 14pt

### Layout Principles

- **Rule of Thirds**: Divide slides into 3 sections
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important information largest
- **White Space**: Don't overcrowd slides
- **Consistency**: Use same style across all slides

### Animation Suggestions

- **Slide 1**: Animate flowchart to show process step by step
- **Slide 2**: Animate transformation from manual to automated
- **Slide 3**: Animate ROI numbers appearing

### Speaker Notes

- **Slide 1**: "This is the reality our operations team faces every day..."
- **Slide 2**: "OrderBot represents a fundamental shift in how we handle orders..."
- **Slide 3**: "The numbers speak for themselves, but let's start small and prove the concept..."

This presentation structure provides a clear, compelling narrative that moves from problem identification through solution design to actionable next steps, all while maintaining focus on business value rather than technical complexity.
